# a list of students
# a list of scores (same length)
#  Return the names of students whose name has more than 3 vowels AND whose score is above average score.
#  Use nested loops (one to count vowels, one to compute average).
# Input:
#  students = ["Aravind", "Bala", "Eeshwar", "Louis", "Gita"]
#  scores = [85, 70, 92, 88, 60]
# Output:
#  ["Aravind", "Eeshwar", "Louis"]
