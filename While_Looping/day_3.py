## 1. Write a program that uses a while loop to print numbers from 1 to 5.
# a = 1
# b = 5
# while a < 6:
#     print(a)
#     a +=1



# 2. Write a program that uses a while loop to count down from 5 to 1.
# a = 5
# b = 1
# while a > 1:
#     print(a)
#     a -=1

# 3. Use a while loop to print the message "Hello, Python!" three times.
# count = 0
# while 0 > 3:
#     print('hello world')
#     count+=1
    

# 4. Even numbers: Use a while loop to print all the even numbers between 1 and 10.

# a = 1
# b = 10
# while a <= b:
#     if a % 2 == 0:
#         print(a)
#     a +=1

# 5. Multiplication table
# Ask the user for a number n and print its multiplication table up to 10 using a while loop.

# def is_multiplication (n):
#     # count = 1
#     while n < 10:
#         print( n * count, n   )
#     # count = count +1

#6.  Print odd numbers
# Print all odd numbers between 1 and 15 using a while loop.

# a = 1
# b = 15
# while a <= b:
#     if a % 2 != 0:
#         print(a)
#     a = a + 1

# 7. Square of Numbers
# Print the squares of numbers from 1 to 5 using a while loop.
# (Example: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25)

# num = 1
 
# while num <= 5:
#     square = num * num
#     print(square)
#     num = num + 1


# 8. Factorial calculation
# Ask the user for a number n and calculate n! (factorial) using a while loop.

# i = 1
# fact =1
# n = int(input("Enter your number:"))


# while i <= n:
#     fact = fact * i
#     i = i +1
# print("The factorial is: ", fact)

# 9. Backward Count
# # Print numbers from 10 down to 1 using a while loop.

# a = 10
# b = 1

# while a >= 1:
#     print(a)
#     a = a -1

## 10. Sum of First 5 Numbers
# Use a while loop to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 5.

# a = 1
# b = 5
# sum = 0

# while a <= 5:
#     sum = sum + a
#     a = a +1
# print(sum)
